  <p>I’ve had a camera in my hands since I was a kid. Something changed for me after a trip to Marine World. When I got the photos back, I had captured the exact moment a dolphin was jumping through a hoop. That one shot sparked something. I knew right then photography was more than a hobby.</p>
  <p>Back in those days I didn’t just love taking photos. I loved the chemistry side of it too. Developing film, watching the image come to life in a tray of developer, that felt like real magic. Things are different now with digital, but the feeling of chasing a great shot hasn’t gone anywhere.</p>
  <p>Over the years I’ve photographed everything from race cars to bike racing to street scenes in San Francisco. I’m drawn to motion and energy. Panning is one of my favorite techniques, especially with fast-moving subjects. Sometimes I get so into it the result becomes more than a photo. It turns abstract, like the motion itself got frozen into art.</p>
  <p>I don’t stage photos. I don’t chase perfect lighting. I chase real moments. This site is a collection of those moments. Honest, fast, sometimes quiet, sometimes loud, but always real.</p>
